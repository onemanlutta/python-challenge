# python-challenge

There are two challenges here that utilize the foundations of Python in data and data types to address real-world challenges in finance (PyBank) and elections (PyPoll). Data utilized is in csv format, and Python is utilized to analyze the datasets in Visual Studio Code. These projects demonstrate reading and writing to csv and text files, how to store content in variables, lists, and dictionaries, how to use list comprehension, conditionals, loops and work with basic data structures and functions.

## PyBank



In this Challenge, I demonstrate how to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company for a dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## About the Script
You can find the script named VBAStockSolution.bas and VBAStockSolution.txt in this repository. The script file is also available in the macro-enabled workbook, Multiple_year_stock_data_ALM.xlsm.

## The Solution
The script iterates through all the stocks data in ago.

### Solution 1 - Ticker Symbol
The script prints the unique ticker symbols in ascending order in column "I" with a column header "Ticker.

### Solution 2 - Yearly Change
The script excutes Yearly Change from the opening price at the start of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, putting the value in column "J". Through the code a conditional formatting is added highlighting positive change in green and negative change in red.

### Solution 3 - Precent Change
Calculates percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, and puts the value in column "K".

### Solution 4 - Total stock Volume
Similarly, total stock volume gets genereated in column "L".

### Solution 5 - Greatest: ~ increase, ~ decrease, and ~ total volume
Provides the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
