# python-challenge

There are two challenges here that utilize the foundations of Python in data and data types to address real-world challenges in finance (PyBank) and elections (PyPoll). Data utilized is in csv format, and Python is utilized to analyze the datasets in Visual Studio Code. These projects demonstrate reading and writing to csv and text files, how to store content in variables, lists, and dictionaries, how to use list comprehension, conditionals, loops and work with basic data structures and functions.

## PyBank

In this Challenge, I demonstrate how to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company for a dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
   

The following is a snip of the expected output:

## About the Solution

You can find the solution of PyBank in the file called main.py ![main.py]PyBank/main.py in the root of the PyBank directory, which has a folder called Resources with the dataset used in this analysis (budget_data.csv), and another folder called analysis in which there is the text file called financialanalysis.txt, ![financialanalysis.txt]PyBank/analysis/financialanalysis.txt with the final results of the analysis. 



## PyPoll

In this Challenge, I demonstrate how to create a Python script to demonstrate how a small, rural town could modernize its vote-counting process using a dataset called election_data.csv. The dataset has three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate"..

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

1. The total number of votes cast

2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

3. The percentage of votes each candidate won

4. The total number of votes each candidate won

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

## About the Solution

You can find the solution of PyPoll in the file called main.py ![main.py]PyPoll/main.py in the root of the PyPoll directory, which has a folder called Resources with the dataset used in this analysis (election_data.csv), and another folder called analysis in which there is the text file called electionanalysis.txt, ![electionanalysis.txt]PyPoll/analysis/electionanalysis.txt with the final results of the analysis.
